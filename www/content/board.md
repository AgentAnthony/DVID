## Board discovering
The board core is composed by a Atmega328p and a OLED screen. For each vulnerabilities, a firmware could be flashed on the Atmega328p in order to offer a specific vulnerable environment.

There is also connection port like UART, Bluetooth, 2,4Ghz and Wifi. In each vulnerability, a specific extension board must be plugged to the board.

Hacking required attacks tools like USBasp and USBuart.

## Board

You can buy the board on marketplace (available soon) or build it yourself with Gerber files.
The board is shipped with theses three packages :

* **Board only and component reference** : Naked board only. You must buy all component yourself and solder all component.

* **Soldered board without attack component and extention** : Soldered board but you must buy all external tools like USBuart, USBasp, extention board.

* **Full package** : Everything needed (soldered board, external board and attack tools).
